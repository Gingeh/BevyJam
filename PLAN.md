# The Plan
Top secret! *shh*

**Theme**: *Side Effects*

### Ideas
1. Puzzle platformer where the player needs to use powerups that give them special abilities but also have adverse **side effects** they must deal with.
	- The player is a thief, stealing potions from an experimental laboratory. 
	- Could be called Potion Plunderer?
2. Rhythm game where the player rotates some kind of shape so that the right **sides** hit the right notes.
	- Probably wouldn't be too hard to make
	- A *Spaceship!* dodging *asteroids!*
	- Kinda like that part in the Undyne battle from Undertale
3. Card game where cards can be flipped which makes them do different things
	- Maybe the cards flip when they 'die'? (like ghosts (spooky))
